Code for my Google Capstone Project

This was previously on my [Portfolio Projects repository](https://github.com/kellyjadams/portfolioProjects). But because it has more than one file I decided to create a repository for this larger project. I have kept the original code in the Portfolio Projects Repository for version control.

Below are the links to everything related to the Capstone Project. 
- [**Google_Capstone_Project.R**](https://github.com/kellyjadams/portfolioProjects/blob/main/Google_Capstone_Project.R) - analyzed the data set from case study 1 in the Google Data Analytics Course using R. I did not do any data visualization in R.
- [**Google_Capstone_Project_T.R**](https://github.com/kellyjadams/portfolioProjects/blob/main/Google_Capstone_Project_T.R) - used code to create a specific data frame to use in Tableau. Deleted unncessary columns to make the code run quicker in Tableau. 
- [**Article**](https://www.kellyjadams.com/post/google-capstone-project) - wrote an article summarizing my findings.
- [**Tableau Dashboard**](https://public.tableau.com/views/GoogleCapstoneProjectCyclistic/Dashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) - created a dashboard in Tableau summarizing the data.
